                <p>Electronics and Computer Science Club was established by the undergraduates of the degree program of BSc (Hons) in 
                    Electronics and Computer Science. All the undergraduates of the particular degree program are having the membership 
                    of the club. Mainly, this degree program of BSc (Hons)in Electronics and Computer Science is offering by the Department 
                    of Electronics, Department of Computer Science and Department of Mathematics.<br><br>
                    The Department of Physics at the University of Kelaniya, established in 1967, is one of eight departments in the 
                    Faculty of Science. It has continuously updated academic programs and improved lab facilities. In 2019, it was 
                    renamed the Department of Physics and Electronics. Similarly, the Department of Statistics & Computer Science was 
                    founded in 1999 to address growing education needs in those fields. The Department of Mathematics has been teaching 
                    since the university's inception in 1959, formally establishing in 1967 under the Faculty of Science, offering both
                    Pure and Applied Mathematics for the Bachelor of Science degree.<br><br>

                    As the degree program Electronics and Computer Science initially started recently (in the year 2022 for 2020 A/L students), 
                    this club will be a great platform to increase the visibility of our undergraduates.
                    We are here to generate more ideas to the industry through our members and to make a great bond with the industry. Through
                    our club, we wish to improve the skills of our undergraduates through workshop series, Robotic Battle Competitions and  
                    Electronics and Computer Science based competitions.</p>
